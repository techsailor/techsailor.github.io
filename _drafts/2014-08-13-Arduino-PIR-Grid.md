The boats on our mud berths were being tampered with, (probably only
youths *having fun* during the summer holiday, but irritating
never-the-less and costly!). Someone brought up that they had
mentioned "we needed a security system ..." , at a recent comittee
meeting, and re-ittereated in his reply, and "..., might it not still
be a valid thing to try and organise and put in place ?"

A small group of people put in a bit of time to help organise and
preserve a facility, that otherwise wouldn't exist, and then users
demand further facilities, for fear of being "not fit for purpose" and
"a health and safety risk". God they make me sick.

Anyway, secure the area ? A reply to the irritating twat came from a
founder member [Thank God!], "We need power !", and included a link to
a Â£800 solar+battery+PIR+camera kit from Maplin. And maybe that is
still an option. (900/30 members == 20 one off charge).
